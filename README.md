Liz | Logic App🚀

Liz | Logic is a responsive social web app designed not just for functionality, but for user ownership, flexibility, and experience.

This project reflects my approach:

🔹 Start with structure.

🔹 Focus on real user intentions.

🔹 Build systems that can scale.

Features:

Theme Switch 🌗
Light mode = fresh.
Dark mode = focus.
→ Users pick how they experience the app.

Font Size Control:
Not just text resizing, it's ownership.
Users decide how they want to read, and the UI adapts.

Stories:
More than pictures → a way for users to say: “See me.”

Create "post" Button:
Not just a button → a dare: show up and share.

Responsive Design 📱💻
Fully adaptable across devices, clean on desktop, smooth on mobile.


🛠️ Tech Stack:

HTML5 → Structure


CSS3 → Styling & 


JavaScript (Vanilla JS) → Interactivity & 


Vercel → 


GitHub → Version control & documentation


⚡ No frameworks yet. This is intentional. The first version focuses on fundamentals and structure — because no framework can save a bad foundation.

Lessons & Intentions:

Design isn’t colours → it’s conversations.

UI isn’t shapes → it’s trust.

Buttons aren’t buttons → they’re dares.

Visibility = accountability → I push projects early to GitHub.
